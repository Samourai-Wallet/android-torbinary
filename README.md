# Android-TorBinary

Tor Binary build for Android

Installs the Tor executable file in your Android Application's
native library directory (`/data/app/...`) with the file name `libTor.so`.  

Based on <a href="https://github.com/05nelsonm/TOPL-Android-TorBinary" target="_blank">05nelsonm/TOPL-Android-TorBinary</a>  
 
## Where do the binaries come from?  

They are built using The GuardianProject's <a href="https://github.com/guardianproject/tor-android" target="_blank">tor-android</a>
project, then copied to  
the `tor-binary` module. Doesn't come with anything but the executables.
